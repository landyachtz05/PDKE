Documentation for Climate Change, Climate Variability, and Drought (CCVD) Portfolio production steps
Author: Derek Ford
Original date: 1/4/2024

Step 1: Define area of interest
Input for this should be a polygon shapefile. Only the .shp file is needed for input.

Step 2: Check inputs of certain lines of CCVD_portfolio_content.R
Line 45: output location
Line 46: "CCVD INPUTS" folder
Line 47: same as output location
Line 111: AOI (polygon shapefile)
Line 113: Full name of AOI
Line 114: Short name of AOI
Line 115: Island full name
Line 116: Island abbreviation

Step 3: Run CCVD_portfolio_content.R

Step 4: Check inputs of certain lines of CCVD_portfolio_ppt.R
Line 17: Step 2 output location (see above)
Line 19: "IMAGE" folder contains static images (logos, etc.)
Line 20: same as Line 17
Line 21: output location
Line 28: select correct AOI from folder
Line 32: current version of CCVD portfolio

Step 4: Check PPT slides (data tables may need to be adjusted)

Step 5: Convert PPT to PDF if needed for sharing/file size

------------------------
To use:
1.) Edit CCVD_portfolio_content.R to use correct paths and files.
2.) Run CCVD_portfolio_content.R to generate all the images and plots
3.) Run CCVD_portfolio_ppt.R to generate the powerpoint

------------------------
TODO:
1.) Get CCVD_portfolio_ppt.R to run
2.) Make both files take all file names and paths as command line variables.
3.) Make a file that contains all the input and output paths/files and runs the code, so only that needs to be edited going forward.
4.) Start compartmentalizing the code so any one output can be generated independently of the others.
5.) Develop a front end interface that allows user to select a Polygon from pre-existing areas
6.) Develop a front end interface that allows user to hand-draw a polygon.  user also would need to provide: Site full name, Site short name, and maybe island full name and short name (or get that from where they select/island they made their polygon on).
7.) Add mechanism to auto-update rainfall data from HCDP (see Cherryle's script)
8.) Make file names not use years

Questions:
- What output do you want it to do?  Is it displaying results from the portfolio_content script, or is it the downloadable PDF, or something else?
- What are the inputs the user will need to define?  What can be pre-populated (like drop down menus) and what needs to be them typing it in or uploading?  When you are running this, what values possibly get edited?
- Why are some values defined twice?  (ex: RFUnit = " in" & RFUnit2 = "in")


----

- Never change
- periodically updated by us
- provided/selected by user (waikiki_watershed/waikiki_watershed.shp - this is what user will either upload or draw)


Monthly rainfall maps (get from HCDP)

ILE <- "Oahu" (island of area of interest)
ILE_s <- "OA" (short name of island, we can automate this)
