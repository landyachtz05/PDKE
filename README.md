# PDKE

Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange
Repository created for sharing code related to PDKE products. Currently included:
CCVD Portfolio

## Setup:
### Download and install R and RStudio (free version)

R: https://cran.r-project.org/
RStudio: https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/

### Setup your credentials file

Create a credentials.json file in the project's root directory.  It should look like this:
{
  "PROJ_LIB_VAL": "/opt/anaconda3/share/proj/",
  "RSCRIPT_PATH": "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/Rscript",
  "bearer": ""
}
Edit the PROJ_LIB_VAL to be the path to wherever your proj.db file is (do a search).
Edit RSCRIPT_PATH to point at your Rscript (try whereis Rscript)
Ask the PDKE administrator for the bearer value.

### Set up the folder structure

- Make a folder called CCVD in the project's root directory
- In the CCVD directory, make a new folder called CCVD_OUTPUTS.  The structure should be CCVD/CCVD_OUTPUTS.
- In the CCVD directory, make a new folder called MINI_PPT.  The structure should be CCVD/MINI_PPT.
- In the CCVD directory, make a new folder called MINI_Phase2.  The structure should be CCVD/MINI_Phase2.

### Download files from Google Drive (ask Admin for access)

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QwQU3ulooAeSRmm6rNC8JMGo22aXdgzN
- Download the Shapefiles folder into the PDKESite directory, include the folder so the structure is PDKESite/Shapefiles.
- Download the data folder, and it's contents, into the CCVD folder so the structure is CCVD/data.
- Download the CCVD_INPUTS folder, and it's contents, into the CCVD folder so the structure is CCVD/CCVD_INPUTS.
- Download the IMAGE folder, and it's contents, into the CCVD folder so the structure is CCVD/IMAGE.
- Download the NEW_RF_MAPS folder, and it's contents, into the CCVD folder so the structure is CCVD/NEW_RF_MAPS.

### To run the program

#### Using RStudio on your local machine

Install r and RStudio
Open server.R and click the run button.  The GUI opens and you either select a pre-existing shapefile
or create a new one by clicking on the map.  Make sure the 'Name' and 'Short Name' fields 
are filled in.  Enter your email address and click "Generate Data" button.
This starts a process that takes about 40 minutes.  When it's finished running, look in the MINI_PPT
folder and there will be a new pdf named something like: <Name>_<YYYY>_<MM>_<DD>_CCVD_Portfolio.pdf.

### Using R server (website)

The R server is hosted on Jetstream.  To access it, go to the following link:
https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/projects/ae2152821a6a4d5d866e10698d616466/regions/IU/servers/bbda40a9-0435-45f6-9fc3-7464afd56a53

The following is the current incarnation, I expect the url to change.

#### Setting up on Jetstream:

- Login to Jetstream: https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/projects
- Use "ACCESS CI (XSEDE)" for identity provider, not "University of Hawaii"
- Click on existing allocation (RAPID: Tuning and Assessing Lahaina Wildfire Models with AI Enhanced Data)
- Click on red “Create” button on the right.
- Select “Instance”
- Select the latest Ubuntu
- Enter the instance name
- Select “Flavor” (most of the small sites I’ve been making, I’ve used m3.small)
- Add to storage size if needed
- For “Enable Web Desktop?” Select: “Yes”
- Create
- Once created and ready, open web desktop, then open terminal and type the following
-- sudo apt install apache2
-- sudo adduser <username>
-- sudo passwd <username>
-- sudo groupadd <groupname>
-- sudo usermod -a -G <groupname> <username>
- If repo is private, generate a personal access token following instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2505096/clone-a-private-repository-github 
- Figure out where you want to put the repo, then clone it.  Ideally it will be cloned into the shiny-server directory, but I had permission issues with that.  I ended up cloning it into the workflow directory, then copying the files over to the shiny-server directory.  Want to take another try at this.

Running/Updating on Jetstream:

Site URL: http://149.165.154.114:3838/PDKESite/ 
GitHub: https://github.com/landyachtz05/PDKE 

To Access for editing: 
Login (2 methods): 
1.) ssh <username>@149.165.154.114
2.) Jetstream site (hoping this will change if we can git clone in /srv/shiny-server:
https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/projects
Use "ACCESS CI (XSEDE)" for identity provider, not "University of Hawaii"
Click on existing allocation (RAPID: Tuning and Assessing Lahaina Wildfire Models with AI Enhanced Data)
Click on Instances
Click on PDKE-Shiny
Click on Web Desktop
Once in a terminal in either method:
cd /home/exouser/workflow
git fetch
git status
git pull –rebase
Shiny Server: https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/218499158-Shiny-Server-Quick-Start-Guides 

To see apache error log:
sudo less /var/log/apache2/error.log
Apache: /var/lib/apache2, /etc/apache2

config file:
/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf
listen 3838 (to do, change to 8080)
location / (to do, try point at the PDKESite dir so can get rid of the subdir in the url, otherwise, move the shiny files into the project's root dir)
site_dir /srv/shiny-server;
log_dir /var/log/shiny-server;
/opt/shiny-server
/var/logs/shiny-server.log

Code is found at:
/srv/shiny-server/PDKESite
/home/exouser/workflow
Tried using the workflow dir as it was supposed to let me automate github updates, but it didn’t work.  Then I tried to point the shiny-server config file to this directory, but there were permission issues.  Finally had to resort to doing git updates in the workflow dir, then doing a copy of the affected files (typically just CCVD_portfolio_content.R, CCVD_portfolio_ppt.R, and the 3 r files in the PDKESite dir).

Had to do an ln for shapefile access while in the main scripts when we started from PDKESite.
/srv/shiny-server/shapefile -> PDKESite/Shapefiles/

Shiny Server will use the [default configuration](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server/blob/master/config/default.config) unless an alternate configuration is provided at `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`. Using the default configuration, Shiny Server will look for Shiny apps in `/srv/shiny-server/` and host them on port 3838. If you plan to host your apps in this directory, you can either copy an app you've already developed to that location:

sudo cp -R ~/MY-APP /srv/shiny-server/
